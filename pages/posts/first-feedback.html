                <p>
                    Hey Ana, welcome to the program! Great to read about your motivation for this study. Our study fits your description where you mention wanting to create new things and be challenged. Since this study is has a focus on programming and not just theory it should fit well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Nice to hear you have already thought about your future after completing this study. Naturally you will get more insight into the posibilities within the field of IT during your study.

                    For the question you had in your "who am I" document. Pretty much all those questions will be answered in the first few weeks of the study. Things like homework and grading really depend on the  course since you have multiple courses the formats can be sligtly different. This will always be mentioned by the teacher in the introduction of a course. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would recommend visiting the lectures and workshops as much as possible since it will help guide you in the right direction. For some subject you will have to do some self studying but this will be much easier if you followed all the lectures related to that subject.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also in the next few weeks you will get a student buddy who can help answer some of the questions you might have about your first year.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kind regards,
                    <br>
                    <br>

                <h3>My thoughts about the feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    I am glad to hear that the course fits my description. I think I did a good job, since the teacher's feedback made me feel relaxed. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I really like the idea that throughout this course I will be able to put into practice all the theory I will learn. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am also very excited that we are going to have a student buddy since I really like to meet new people and at the same time it makes me feel more confident since he/she will probably help me clarify my doubts and give me good advice.</p>
